  - title: Ways to start a story
    description: |
      - ðŸ’» `Run /story begin` - Begin the story by command
      - âš½ `Click 'Start Story'` - Begin the story by component
      - ðŸ’¾ `Run /story resume` - Resume the last story run, if any
  - title: Reverse Event Flow
    description: |
      The intention is to flip the method flow on its head - to prioritize listening for the components themselves as one listener and then use that to unify slash command and component listeners.
  - title: State Management
    description: |
      Managing state between steps in the current way still requires a syntax of sorts, but it acts as an object reference in memory.
      Conceptually making it, is the easy part - making it work, and demonstrating it - there's the challenge.
      
      <details>
        <summary>Session Persisence</summary>
        A database would be required if stories end up getting the 'save' ability.
      </details>
  - title: Modal Interactions
    description: |
      Modal's are still under development, but they may allow for a more diverse interaction flow - as well as more variability.
  - title: Bucket Support (Open Source)
    description: |
      Focusing on getting the bucket core functional with integration as a git submodule.
