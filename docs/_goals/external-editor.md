An interface app to assist with the creation of story files.
This would include rendering a scene message with assistance from a module like `skyra-project/discord-components`.

While the prototype illustrates the use of a node graph editor, it is not a requirement to begin with that or have it implemented in the application in the future - instead it serves as a guide for what could be possible in future development. An alternative to building a full application would be to provide it as an extension to an editor like Visual Studio Code. The principle is the same in terms of the goal to achieve, but the implementation and target audience would be different.
