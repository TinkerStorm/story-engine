progress: 30

Current structure uses YAML as such:

```yaml
name: "My Story"
description: |
  This is a story about...
author: "John Doe"

starts_with: start

steps:
  start:
    payload: |
      This is the start of the story.
    routing:
      next: branch
  branch:
    payload:
      content: |
        This is the branch of the story.
      components:
        - type: 2
          style: 1
          label: Left
          custom_id: left
          emoji: ðŸ‘ˆ
        - type: 2
          style: 1
          label: Right
          custom_id: right
          emoji: ðŸ‘‰
    routing:
      left: left
      right: right
  left:
    routing: end
    payload: |
      This is the **left** branch of the story.
  right:
    routing: end
    payload: |
      This is the **right** branch of the story.
```

However there is a possibility to use alternative data exchange formats. For example, JSON; TOML; etc.

<div class="row">
<div class="col">
{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "My Story",
  "description": "This is a story about...",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "starts_with": "start",
  "steps": {
    "start": {
      "payload": "This is the start of the story.",
      "routing": {
        "next": "branch"
      }
    },
    "branch": {
      "payload": {
        "content": "This is the branch of the story.",
        "components": [
          {
            "type": 2,
            "style": 1,
            "label": "Left",
            "custom_id": "left",
            "emoji": "ðŸ‘ˆ"
          },
          {
            "type": 2,
            "style": 1,
            "label": "Right",
            "custom_id": "right",
            "emoji": "ðŸ‘‰"
          }
        ]
      },
      "routing": {
        "left": "left",
        "right": "right"
      }
    },
    "left": {
      "routing": "end",
      "payload": "This is the **left** branch of the story."
    },
    "right": {
      "routing": "end",
      "payload": "This is the **right** branch of the story."
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="col">
{% highlight toml %}
name = "My Story"
description = "This is a story about..."
author = "John Doe"
starts_with = "start"

[steps.start]
payload = "This is the start of the story."
routing = { next = "branch" }

[steps.branch]
routing = { left = "left", right = "right" }

[steps.branch.payload]

[[steps.branch.payload.components]]
type = 2

[[steps.branch.payload.components]]
type = 2
style = 1
label = "Right"
custom_id = "right"
emoji = "ðŸ‘‰"

[steps.left]
routing = "end"
payload = "This is the **left** branch of the story."

</div>

Use of a data schema would be a good way to ensure that the each story is valid and consistent, and that the data is in the right format.

For example, message payloads can either be a string or a JSON object (represented as a Discord Message). Verifying that each scene is a valid object before being sent off to Discord greatly reduces the risk of being ratelimited or otherwise banned by their safeguards.

**With regards to the existing data structure, it would look something like this:**
  > *`discord-message` and `discord-component` definitions have not been added as declarations yet, but the structure is the same as how the API defines it.*
