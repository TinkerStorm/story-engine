It is important to note that the route summary is not a part of the story itself, but is a way to show the reader where they came from - and part of a diagnostic tool to help writers understand how their stories are structured (what each step is doing, how they are branching, and the chances of success on each weighted route). Their is a more pressing concern for how numbers are handled in these compilers, and how they are used to calculate the weighted route ([role ratio scale demo](https://sudojunior.github.io/2021/12/10/number-limits)) - simple math calculations can and will throw off the results *marginally*.
