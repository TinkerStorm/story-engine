- How can communities be supported to host their own bucket / service?
- What can community admins do to support their writers?

A future stretch goal would be to allow communities to host their own bucket, but add it to the list on the primary service. This would require a disclaimer stating that it is not maintained by the service creator - and also a modification to support multiple buckets at once.
