- 💻 `Run /story begin` - Begin the story by command
- ⚽ `Click 'Start Story'` - Begin the story by component
- 💾 `Run /story resume` - Resume the last story run, if any
- 🌐 Start from a web page - Useful for testing and sharing stories without need for the service

The intention is to provide a different way to not only start a story, but promote the story to a more permanent platform where it can be shared and used by others. This would be a good way to advance the usage of components, and to make sure that the story is not only seen by one person, but also by others when they they are searching around.
